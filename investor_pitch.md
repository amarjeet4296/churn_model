# Revolutionizing Travel: The AI-Driven Retention Engine

---

## 1. The Problem: The Leaky Bucket of Travel
- **High Acquisition Costs**: Acquiring a new traveler costs **5-25x** more than retaining an existing one.
- **Razor-Thin Margins**: With 10-15% commission rates, losing just 20 loyal customers = **$10k-$15k loss**.
- **The Silent Exit**: 67% of travelers want proactive engagement, but most agencies only send a receipt. They leave silently.

> "Travel is episodic. If you don't engage in the gaps, you lose the customer."

## 2. The Solution: Predictive Churn Management
Introducing **TravelRetain AI** – a platform that stops churn before it happens.

### How It Works
1.  **Data Ingestion**: We analyze booking history, support tickets, and digital engagement.
2.  **AI Prediction**: Our Random Forest model identifies "At-Risk" customers with **85%+ accuracy**.
3.  **Proactive Intervention**: Automatically triggers personalized offers, check-ins, or support escalations.
